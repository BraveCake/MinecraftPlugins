## EnhancedChat
A plugin that extends the existing minecraft chat by adding extra functionalities such as :-
- Sending messages the can only be seen by nearby players within a specific blocks range (default 250 blocks) via /loc <message> 
- Replying quickly on the most recently received whisper message using /re <message>

## UnlimitedEnchantments
A plugins that removes enchantment limitations so players can have any enchantment on any enchantable item for instance you can have various protection enchantments on a single armor that's usually not possible without creative mode.
